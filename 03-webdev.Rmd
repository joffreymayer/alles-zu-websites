## Definitionen

- **Art Direction Problem**: This is the problem of a responsive image, which - on the Computer // _landscape-mode_ - you can see the relevant parts of the image, but - on an Ipad // Iphone // _potrait-mode_ - you need to crop the image differently, otherwise you . This problem can be solved with the `<picture>`- & `<source>`-element in HTML (as well as the `srcset`-attribute in the CSS of the `<source`-element), that allows you tell the browser, which image it needs to select, based on the screen-size it faces.
- **Bandwidth**: Bandwidth in website hosting is the amount of data your website can transfer to your users in a given amount of time.
  - <u>Why is this important</u>: When you deal with **images, especially for smaller screens, such as phones**. The problem here is, that a **very big images can take alot of bandwidth (up to 60%)**. As a consequence, it slows down the performance of the site, which is the most important thing Google cares about when ranking websites!
- **CRUD**: This is an acronym, which refers to the **4 functions, that are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application**:
  - **<u>c</u>**reat
  - **<u>r</u>**ead, 
  - **<u>u</u>**pdate and 
  - **<u>d</u>**elete.
    - <u>Example of a CRUD Application</u>: Facebook, Instagram or TikTok, because each of those apps lets you:
      - **C-** Create posts, videos, comments, likes etc. 
      - **R-** Read posts, view pictures, see like counts, see followers of other users etc. 
      - **U-** Edit posts, pictures, comments, profiles and update them etc. and finally 
      - **D-** Delete posts, pictures, comments, videos etc.
- **Dependency // Dependencies**: A dependency is a **third-party bit of software** that was probably written by someone else and ideally solves a single problem for you. A web project can have any number of dependencies, ranging from none to many, and **your dependencies might include sub-dependencies that you didn't explicitly install** — your dependencies may have their own dependencies.
  - <u>Example</u>: A useful dependency that your project might need is some **code to calculate relative dates as human-readable text**. You could certainly code this yourself, but there's a strong chance that someone else has already solved this problem 
  — <u>Vorteil 1</u>: *Why waste time reinventing the wheel?*
  - <u>Vorteil 2</u>:  Moreover, a reliable third-party dependency will likely have been tested in a lot of different situations, making it **more robust and cross-browser compatible** than your own solution.
- **Package Manager**: **A package manager is a system that will manage your project dependencies**. 
  - <u>Example</u>: When you use a dependenciy // third-party code, you will need to update it, if a new version gets released. If you have MANY dependencies, then you will need a *package manager* such as **`npm`**, because it will guarantee that the *updated* code is added and the *old one* is removed cleanly.
  - <u>Why should you use a packet manager?</u>: _In theory_, you may <u>not</u> need a package manager and you could manually download and store your project dependencies, but a package manager will seamlessly handle installing and uninstalling packages.
  - <u>Important Detail about `npm`</u>: The `npm` packet manager for `JavaScript` is the analog thing as a **virtual environment** in `python`!
    - <u>Quelle</u>: See the last answer on [this Stack-Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47272966/is-installing-nodejs-packages-locally-equivalent-to-pythons-virtualenv/47284674) thread.
- **Usability Testing**: Suche jemand, der deine Webseite austestet, die du gerade konstruiert hast. Er soll dir ein ehrliches Feedback geben.
  <u>Wichtig</u>: We test the Site, not the user. It is important that the user knows, that he is not tested, but rather the website. The user can't do anything wrong. 
- **Web Server**: When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a _web server_ which hosts the website. 
  - Web servers are special **computers that are constantly connected to the Internet**, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who request them.
  - Some big companies run their own web servers, but it is more **common to use the services of a web hosting company** who charge a fee to host your site.
- **Screen Readers**: Screan readers are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people with visual impairments.
- **relative URLs**: When you are linking to a page on your own website, you do not need to specify the domain name. An **example for a relative URL** would be `<a href="accuphase.html"`, in contrast to an **_absoulte URL**, which would be `<a href="https://audiophil-dreams.com/accuphase.html">`.
- **Data-Type `NULL`**: A variable of data type `NULL` is a variable that has _no <u>value</u>_ assigned to it. For example (in JS), if you declare a variable `const noob`, but you - intentionally - don't want to give it a specific value, then it will output a value of `NULL`, when you use `console.log(noob)` on it.
- **Classes (Object Oriented Programming)**: A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of class. When we create `individual objects` - aka new variables, like "apple", "banana", etc. - from a `class`, those new variables inherit all the `properties` (= Variables defined WITHIN the class // Eigenschaften) and `behaviors` (= Functions // Methods // Verhalten) from the `class`, but _each_ `individual object` // variable (that is created from the `class`) will have different <u>**values**</u> for the properties // variables (defined within the `class`). 
  - <u>Note</u>: In a `class`, variables are called `properties` and functions are called `methods`!
  - <u>Beispiel</u>: https://www.w3schools.com/PHP/php_oop_classes_objects.asp
- **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)**: AJAX is about updating parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

## How does the Web work?

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a _Domain Name System_ (DNS) server. 

**It is the DNS servers that tell your browser _how_ to find the website you want to see displayed on your screen // where (= at which location) in the world the web server is located, in order to show the user the site**.

### Example

**This example explains how a user - from a _specific_ country (UK) - tries to find the location of a _specific_ web server (FR) (bzw. how to contact it...), in order for it to access AND display a particular website on the user's computer- // tablet- // phone-browser**.

<u>For instance, let's assume that</u>:

- You - as a user - currently live in Cambridge (UK) AND you want to go to visit the Louvre museum in France.

> Schritt 1

When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP), for example via internet-company _Salt_. You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site; for example: `louvre.fr`.

> Schritt 2

Next, your computer contacts a network of servers called `Domain Name System` (DNS) servers. These **act like phone books**: they will tell your computer the exact `IP-address`, that is associated with the requested domain name (= which is `louvre.fr` in this example).

- <u>Note</u>: An `IP-address` is a number of up to 12 digits separated by `.`-Zeichen. Every device connected to the web has a <u>**unique**</u> `IP-address`: it is like a phone number for a particular computer.

> Schritt 3

The unique number that the `DNS-server` <u>returns</u> to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested, e.g. `louvre.fr`.

- <u>Note</u>: A **web server** is a computer that is _constantly_ connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.

> Schritt 4

Finally, the web server then sends the (HTML + CSS + JS) files you requested back to your web browser, which is able to render the obtained files properly ion your browser.

## Image-Management

A website's browser has the task of downloading those images when it reads an HTML-document. 

<mark>Most of the time, images are the entities that need the most time to load on a website, which is why a site with _many_ images can have a big (negative) impact on the website's performance, because many images take a looot of time to load and - therefore - you will have a poor user-experience, especially on mobile</mark>.

_That's why you need a good image-management when building websites_.

<u>The following areas lead to a better image-management and - hence - better site-performance</u>:

- Resolution of images
- Caching strategies tha use CDNs
- Implement Lazy-Loading

### Resolution of images

When you need a responsive-solution for your images, the _least complicated_ thing to do, is to tackle the image-resolution of your images that are displayed on the screen. 

_It may seem complicated at first sight, but understanding this chapter will be key for later simplicity & a significant increase in the site's performance_.

### The Problem

As you may know, I like to show my visitors on the site a beautiful hero-image. I am convinced that a it increases the visitor's interest in the site. 

However - from a technical point of view - you get **terrible LCP-Scores** (= _largest contentful paint_), since the _mermory-heavy_ image you need to show to the user needs to be downloaded from a server. This can take a large amount of data to transfer (up to 60%) - **especially when big images are requested from a user // browser to the server** - which is why the loading time can be very long. 

_As a consequence, the performance (in terms of loading time) of your site is poor - particularly on phones - and the visitor is going to leave your site, IF the loading takes too long_.

### The solution 

Nevertheless - **with the help of the `picture`- & `source`-element** - you can solve the problem of a _memory-intensive_ image that need to be downloaded for a hero-image.

In [this Youtube-Video of myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud3mdXwqdtc), I show & explain the solution I have chosen.

- <u>To get a very solid foundation about the topic</u>: `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images`
- <u>To get a very good example of applying this foundation in practice</u>: `https://formidable.com/blog/2019/responsive-images/` 
  - <u>A second good example</u>: `https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/responsive-images-done-right-guide-picture-srcset/`

### Useful things to know about the Topic

When you use the `<picture>`-element in combination with the `<source>`-element, it is required that you use a `<img>`-Tag at the end. Most of the websites - and even the "official" source - however, don't tell you how this `<img>` work exactly (but I will, because this little bit of keyknowledge will make you understand, why the "performance"-score in the light-house is improved after you use the `<picture>`- & `<source>`-elements):

- <u>Important</u>: The `<picture>`-element itself is invisible, a bit like a magical span. Its `source`-element<u>s</u> are just there for the browser to draw alternate versions of the image from. <mark>Once a source URL is chosen, that URL is fed to the `<img>`-Element</mark>. _Additionally_, this means that any styles that you want to apply to your rendered image (like, say, max-width: 100%) need to be applied to the `<img>`-element, <u>not</u> to the `<picture>`-element.

### Cache

When using a website, the images oftentimes stay relatively "static", that is they - oftentimes - *do not change over time*. This fact - that the image-content does almost never change over time - can be exploited in order to dimish loading-time significantly with the help of a cache-strategy. 

#### The Problem 

By storing the images on our website's server (VTX), the user's browser will have to always make requests. Because I have many images, we have _a lot of image-requests per page_ that the user renders on his phone. Hence, the loading time takes long. 

#### The theoretical Solution

<mark>It would be much more efficient - from a performance // loading perspective - if the user had those images already stored in their computer's internal (cache) memory. This is where CDNs come into play: those are servers that are distributed all across the globe and that</mark>: 

1) Visit our website.
2) Then cache // store the images on their server, _which is close to the user, from a <u>geographical</u> standpoint_.

When a user visit our website, the requests for images will be forwarded to the (geographically, much more close the user) CDNs that will already have downloaded the images of our site.

_This results in a much faster loading-time of our website and an increase in the user's experience._

#### The practical Solution

In order to use a CDN, I recommend this website as a tool to implement a caching-strategy:

- `https://imagekit.io/`


### Lazy-Loading

#### The Problem 

When you code an HTML-page and you include a bunch of images, you will have to tell the browser, on which path the images can be loaded via the `src`-atribute of the `<img>`-tag. 

_However - IF you have many `<img src=....>`-tags on your site - the browser will **automatically load them all at once**. And because loading image-entities is one of the most slow process when it comes to make everything visible on the user's browser, having lot's of images can take a long time to load. More specifically, **IF a user directly follows a link to another page on our site**, having downloaded all the pages is very inefficient, since the website-visitor will not have seen those images that are at the bottom of the site._

#### The theoretical Solution 

With JavaScript, we can change the behavior of how load `<img src="...">`-tags. 
**In lazy-loading**, we can tell the browser - with the help of some JavaScript code - that it only needs to load the images, that are visible in the user's viewport // browser-window (= visible portion of the screen). 

*This way, all the images that are on the bottom of our pages, will NEVER be loaded, if the user clicks on a link at the TOP of our page*.

#### The practical Solution

Use the code - which is **written in vanilla JavaScript** - from [this Fireship Youtube-Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUjBvuUdkhg) to make Lazy-Loading possible.
