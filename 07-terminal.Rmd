# Terminal

The **Terminal // Command Line** is a place that helps you:

- to install packages
- setup your computer
- setup your virtual environment (`npm` or `venv`)
- setup a `git`-repo 
- etc...

## Terminal-Commands:

A terminal will be essential for your projects, since you will - oftentimes - install packages or move files around your repositories with it. Here, you will find the most useful things you should know when using the `Terminal`.

### Aktuelle Position // Directory?

- <u>For Mac</u>: `pwd` = print working directory

- <u>For Windows</u>: `dir` = this is the same command as `pwd`, but `dir` is for `Windows`

### Showing the child-directories inside the directory you are currently in?

- `ls` = prints all the `child-directories` (= one layer deeper of the path) from the `parent-directory` (= current directory you are in with your terminal) you are currently in.

### Delete everything you wrote in your `Terminal` up until now?

- `clear` = clears the terminal

### Change directory?

- `cd` = change directory
  - `cd ..` = go back one directory.
  
### Creating a new directory?

`mkdir new-folder-1 new-folder-2 new-folder-3` = This creates 3 new folder within the current (working-) directory you are currently in.

### Create a new file?

`touch index.html app.css` == This will create an `index.html`, as well as a `app.css`-file within the current (working-) directory you are currently in.

### Remove files?

`rm index.html app.css capture.png` = This will delete the `index.html`-, the `app.css` and the `capture.png`-files from the current (working-) directory you are currently in.

## Terminal Magic-Commands for being faster?

- <u>Trick #1</u>: hit the "Tab-Taste" == will automatically auto-fill the name of the file / directories etc.
  - <u>Example</u>: Type `cd Dok` + "Tab"-Taste --> *auto-fill activates* --> im Terminal steht dann der automatisch ausgef√ºllte Name des Files / Directories, zum Beispiel `cd Dokumente` bzw. `cd Name_Of_Child_Directory` 
- <u>Trick #2</u>: How to find a path of a directory that is situated very deeply in your local computer?
  - <u>Example</u>: Type `cd ` + drag-&-drop the **folder** that is deep in your computer with the file in it.
  
### Syntax im Terminal

- `*`-Zeichen == Represents "all files".

#### <u>Beispiel</u>: Delete all Files in a folder that start with the letter `a`?

To delete all files in a folder that start with the letter `a`, then you should write:

```
/folder/a*
```

- `.`-Zeichen == use the `.` character to represent the **current folder**.
- `~`-Zeichen == represents the "home directory".

#### <u>Beispiel</u>: how to return to your home directory?

You should use:

```
cd ~
```

## How to activate &amp; use Python?

`Python` can be executed on your local computer via a `Jupyter Notebook`, which can be accessed through an IDE. `R`, `Visual Studio Code` or `PyCharm` are examples of IDEs. 

Let's assume, that we took `PyCharm` as our IDE. We do the following steps:

1) Use the `Terminal` <u>within</u> PyCharm.
2) Once you opened the PyCharm-`Terminal`, go to the directory that will be used for the Jupyter Notebook, by typing something as `cd /some_folder_name`.
3) Finally, type in `jupyter notebook` in the `Terminal` to launch the Jupyter Notebook App. The notebook interface will appear in a new browser window or tab.
