# Terminal

The **Terminal // Command Line** is a place that helps you:

- to install packages
- setup your computer
- setup your virtual environment (`npm` or `venv`)
- setup a `git`-repo 
- etc...

## Terminal Magic-Commands for being faster?

- <u>Trick #1</u>: hit the "Tab-Taste" == will automatically auto-fill the name of the file / directories etc.
  - <u>Example</u>: Type `cd Dok` + "Tab"-Taste --> *auto-fill activates* --> im Terminal steht dann der automatisch ausgef√ºllte Name des Files / Directories, zum Beispiel `cd Dokumente` bzw. `cd Name_Of_Child_Directory` 
- <u>Trick #2</u>: How to find a path of a directory that is situated very deeply in your local computer?
  - <u>Example</u>: Type `cd ` + drag-&-drop the **folder** that is deep in your computer with the file in it.
  
## Syntax im Terminal

- `*`-Zeichen == Represents "all files".
- `.`-Zeichen == use the `.` character to represent the **current folder**.
- `~`-Zeichen == represents the "home directory".

## Bash

In order to interact with the computer you need to write commands that the computer will be able to understand.

For this purpose, you can use `bash`: **a command language interpreter** for
interacting with a computer from the command line (= terminal). 

**In other words, `bash` is nothing else than the API // Schnittstelle between you - as a programmer - and the computer.**

### What can you do with a Terminal?

Another synonym for the terminal would be "**the shell**", because it surrounds the operating-system (= OS) kernel to hide its intricate details while allowing you - the programmer - to do important stuff like:

- **access data** and 
- **write files**, by typing simple commands 

These two functionalities - enabled through the language `bash` - were a revolutionary concept when it was developed in the early 70s back when programmers were still using punch cards. 

### Geschichtlicher Ursprung von `bash`?

The shell-concept evolved over the years with the "bourne shell" being the most popular version that was used, until 1989 when the **<u>B</u>ourne-<u>A</u>gain shell** - aka `bash` - came about.

### How Terminal & `bash` works | Theoretical Concept

When you open up the Terminal on a *Unix-Machine* - like Mac OS and most linux
distros - the **default shell** is usually `bash`. It provides a "prompt" (siehe Bild unten), where you can type a command, which will then be:

1) **interpreted by the shell** and 
2) **executed on the operating system (= OS)** 

![This is the "prompt".](./bilder/terminal/prompt.png)

### Find out, which Language the Terminal is currently understanding

To find out, if you're running `bash` on your terminal, simply type the following from the command line:

```
which $SHELL
```

### Automation 

*But `bash` *is also a programming language, that allows us to write scripts*.

**This means that anything we type manually into the command line can be automated with code**.

## Terminal-Commands:

A terminal will be essential for your projects, since you will - oftentimes - install packages or move files around your repositories with it. Here, you will find the most useful things you should know when using the `Terminal`.

### Aktuelle Position // Directory?

- <u>For Mac</u>: `pwd` = print working directory

- <u>For Windows</u>: `dir` = this is the same command as `pwd`, but `dir` is for `Windows`

### Showing the child-directories inside the directory you are currently in?

- `ls` = prints all the `child-directories` (= one layer deeper of the path) from the `parent-directory` (= current directory you are in with your terminal) you are currently in.

### Delete everything you wrote in your `Terminal` up until now?

- `clear` = clears the terminal

### Change directory?

- `cd` = change directory
  - `cd ..` = go back one directory.
  
### Creating a new directory?

`mkdir new-folder-1 new-folder-2 new-folder-3` = This creates 3 new folder within the current (working-) directory you are currently in.

### Create a new file?

`touch index.html app.css` == This will create an `index.html`, as well as a `app.css`-file within the current (working-) directory you are currently in.

### Remove files?

`rm index.html app.css capture.png` = This will delete the `index.html`-, the `app.css` and the `capture.png`-files from the current (working-) directory you are currently in.

### How to delete all Files in a folder that start with the letter `a`?

To delete all files in a folder that start with the letter `a`, then you should write:

```
/folder/a*
```

### How to return to your home directory?

You should use:

```
cd ~
```

## How to activate &amp; use Python by using the Terminal?

`Python` can be executed on your local computer via a `Jupyter Notebook`, which can be accessed through an IDE. `R`, `Visual Studio Code` or `PyCharm` are examples of IDEs. 

Let's assume, that we took `PyCharm` as our IDE. We do the following steps:

1) Use the `Terminal` <u>within</u> PyCharm.
2) Once you opened the PyCharm-`Terminal`, go to the directory that will be used for the Jupyter Notebook, by typing something as `cd /some_folder_name`.
3) Finally, type in `jupyter notebook` in the `Terminal` to launch the Jupyter Notebook App. The notebook interface will appear in a new browser window or tab.
