### Welcome to my new database around Websites

### Some useful commands

- Render locally with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")`.

- Use `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to view your book locally (or just open `index.html` in a browser).

- If it looks good, `commit` and `push` all changed files to GitHub. 

- You will need to render the book with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")` and then `commit` & `push` the changes to Github, everytime you make some new changes to your website!

### Edit README

Once you've completed these steps, delete the content of this **README** and add a short description of your project with a link to the book URL. It would be appreciated if you add the following to the end:

*This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/bookdown-template.*
