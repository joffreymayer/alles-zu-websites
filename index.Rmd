# Set-Up 

## Backend: Git & Github

1) Create a **[Github-Account](https://github.com)**.
2) We also need to **[download Git](https://git-scm.com/download)**, a Version-Control System, because you can track all your changes and it is easier to collaborate on Code-Projects.
3) Next, we need to **link our Github-Account to Git**. To do this, use the Terminal and type in the following two commands:

  3.1) `git config --global user.name "YOUR GIBHUB USERNAME HERE"`
  3.2) `git config --global user.email "your_github_email@example.com"`
  
4) **Create a Public & Private SSH-Key** in order to not always type in your password. Follow the instruction of [this Youtube-Tutorial (ab 2:40-4:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfTXHrWMGVY&t=2m40s).
5) In order **to be able to use the SSH-Key**, you need to follow my instruction in the Video on my local computer, situated on the following path: `/Users/jomaye/Nextcloud/Dokumente/Life/Video Tutorials/Github/ssh-key-zum-laufen-bringen.mov`. If the Git code that I provided in the video does not work, then I recommend you to also try this code out: `git remote set-url --add --push origin git@github.com:yourGithubUsername/yourRepo.git`

### Create a new Branch

To create a new branch AND switch to it at the same time, you can use the _short-hand_ command in the terminal:

```
git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME
```

- <u>The above is the same as the following (longer) code</u>:

```
$ git branch  NEW_BRANCH_NAME
$ git checkout  NEW_BRANCH_NAME
```


## Create a Bookdown-Website

1) Use [this Bookdown-Template](https://github.com/jtr13/bookdown-template) to create an awesome website like this one, you are currently at right now.
2) Follow all [the instruction of this 5 Minutes Youtube-Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5D-yoH416Y).
